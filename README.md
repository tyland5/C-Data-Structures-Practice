# C++ Data Structures Practice
This is smaller code that I worked on to help me learn and practice writing in C++. I thought it would be useful in reinforcing some of the things I have learned 
in my Data Structures class while improving my proficiency in an important language.

## Data Structures included 
* [AVL Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree) (AVL.cpp)
* [Binary Heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap#:~:text=A%20binary%20heap%20is%20a,a%20data%20structure%20for%20heapsort.) (BinaryHeap.cpp)
* [Binary Search Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree) (BST.cpp)
* [Doubly Linked List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list) (LinkedList.cpp)
* [Trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20a%20trie,key%2C%20but%20by%20individual%20characters.) (Trie.cpp)
