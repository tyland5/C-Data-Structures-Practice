# C++ Data Structures Practice
This is smaller code that I worked on to help me learn and practice writing in C++. I thought it would be useful in reinforcing some of the things I have learned 
in my Data Structures class while improving my proficiency in an important language.

## Data Structures included 
* AVL Tree (AVL.cpp)
* Binary Heap (BinaryHeap.cpp)
* Binary Search Tree (BST.cpp)
* Doubly Linked List (LinkedList.cpp)
